              I make a lot of art with code but I don't wanna be like the other creative coders out there, keeping their
              programs secret and stuff :/
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I expose most of my programs in this no code app that everybody can use for free without rate limit
            </p>
            <p>
              Have fun using feeding your own pics/vids to my little monsters, and please mention me if you post anything on
              social media
